# WXKDarkSky

This Swift package is a `Decodable` layer over the Dark Sky API for quick and easy access to API response objects. Itâ€™s super straightforward and modeled after the [Dark Sky API docs](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/response)

This package is licensed under the MIT License, which allows you to do just about anything with this Swift package (within Dark Sky's rules, of course) but sue us for any malfunctions. We hope someone finds it useful.
